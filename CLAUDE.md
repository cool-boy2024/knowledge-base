## Vault Overview

A **linked knowledge system** organized around Areas of Focus (Pullein/GAPRA framework). Areas are the foundation — every project, MOC, and task should connect back to an area. The vault handles the *knowledge dimension* of each area.

**Areas of Focus** (`02 - Areas of Focus/`): Defined during onboarding. See `[[Areas of Focus - Pullein Methodology]]`.

**Architecture**: See `[[Vault Architecture]]` for the full structural reference.

**Memory design**: This vault implements four memory types from the CoALA cognitive architecture (Sumers et al. 2023): working memory (CLAUDE.md + rules), procedural memory (skills), episodic memory (auto memory + daily notes), semantic memory (typed vault notes + KG). See `[[Memory Architecture - Why Different Kinds of Memory]]` for why they're separate and how they work together.

**Structural principles**: The semantic memory layer is built under three constraints grounded in formal theory and empirical validation (Barman 2026, Hu 2026, Janowicz 2015):

1. **Bounded branching** — every MOC section, sub-index subsection, and navigational folder keeps its direct-child count $\leq 12$ (the Fano bound on routing reliability). The `/audit` skill checks this automatically (Check F).
2. **Typed edges as interface operations** — edge fields (`concept:`, `extends:`, `supports:`, `criticizes:`, `source:`, `author:`) are not labels; they are operation contracts that tell agents what to do when traversing. Aggressive typing produces a navigable knowledge graph; loose typing collapses into flat similarity search.
3. **Hierarchical retrieval over flat search** — progressive disclosure (VAULT-INDEX → MOC → concept → note) is structural, not cosmetic. Flat semantic retrieval has a mathematical ceiling on correctness that typed hierarchical navigation escapes.

See `[[Bounded Branching - Why This Skill Checks the Fano Bound]]` for the methodology rationale, and the "Structural Constraints on Semantic Memory" section of the Memory Architecture doc for the research basis.

## Navigation [CRITICAL]

**Read VAULT-INDEX.md** at session start for routing to sub-indexes and MOCs.

**Progressive disclosure**: VAULT-INDEX (routing) → Sub-indexes/MOCs (domain) → Individual notes (detail). See `[[How Progressive Disclosure Works]]`.

**CLI-first**: When the Obsidian app is running, prefer `obsidian search`, `obsidian backlinks`, `obsidian tags` over grep for vault queries. See `.claude/rules/vault-navigation.md`.

## Vault Structure

```
/
├── 02 - Areas of Focus/        # THE FOUNDATION — your areas (Pullein)
├── 01 - Projects/              # Time-bound efforts serving areas
├── 03 - Resources/             # Knowledge organized by topic (MOCs)
│   ├── Literature/             # Paper notes + LITERATURE-INDEX.md
│   ├── Obsidian Reference/     # Vault management guides + how-it-works docs
│   └── [your topic folders]/   # Created as your vault grows
├── 04 - Archive/               # Inactive items
├── 05 - Watching/              # Monitored items not yet committed to (fleeting notes)
├── Daily/                      # Daily notes (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
├── Inbox/                      # Unsorted notes (processing queue)
├── Templates/                  # Note templates (7 types)
└── scripts/                    # Helper scripts (KG pipeline)
```

**Hierarchy**: Areas → Goals → Projects → Tasks. Every project should connect to an area via the `area:` edge field.

**Watching folder** (`05 - Watching/`): For items being monitored but not yet committed to — funding opportunities, emerging projects, things flagged for attention. Use `type: fleeting-note` with `status: watching`. When resolved: promote to `01 - Projects/` or archive to `04 - Archive/`. Do NOT put fleeting notes in `Inbox/` — Inbox is a processing queue, not a home.

## Git Protocol [CRITICAL]

```bash
git add [specific-files]
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[Agent: Claude] Brief description

- List specific modifications

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**Never**: force push to main, skip hooks, use `git add -A`, commit without descriptive messages.

---

## Note Typing and Typed Relationships

All new notes must include `type:` in frontmatter. Use edge fields (`up:`, `area:`, `concept:`, `source:`, `extends:`, `supports:`, `criticizes:`) for typed relationships. These fields define the vault's knowledge graph — consumed by the KG pipeline (`scripts/kg/`) for SPARQL queries and by Claude Code for navigation. When creating projects or MOCs, populate `area:` to connect them to an area of focus.

**See**: `.claude/rules/typed-relationships.md` for the full taxonomy

## Cross-Repo Workflow

This vault works alongside your code projects. Two key patterns:

**Two-level planning**: Vault-level plans (`01 - Projects/PLAN.md`) are strategic — research questions, goals, area connections. Repo-level plans (in git repos) are tactical — implementation, architecture. Use `/project-planning` in both contexts.

**The `--add-dir` bridge**: When working in a git repo, run `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1 claude --add-dir /path/to/this/vault` so Claude Code can reference vault knowledge AND load this CLAUDE.md + rules. Without the env var, `--add-dir` gives file access but doesn't load vault instructions.

**Building new skills**: Use Anthropic's built-in `/skill-creator` to build domain-specific skills. Domain skills make domain decisions → delegate note creation to `/encode`.
