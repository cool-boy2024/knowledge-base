# Typed Relationships and Note Typing

Type taxonomy and typed relationship vocabulary for this vault. Edge fields in YAML frontmatter define the vault's knowledge graph — consumed by the KG pipeline (`scripts/kg/`) for SPARQL queries and by Claude Code for navigation. The Breadcrumbs Obsidian plugin can optionally render these as visual hierarchy, but the vocabulary is the vault's own, defined in `scripts/kg/vault-ontology.ttl` and mapped to RDF via `scripts/kg/vault-context.jsonld`.

## Property Standardization

Use `type:` in frontmatter (not `noteType:`). Canonical values:

| Category | Values | Used in |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Knowledge notes | `theory-note`, `concept-note`, `method-note`, `finding`, `implementation-note` | 03 - Resources/[topic]/ |
| Literature | `literature-note`, `book-note`, `author-note` | 03 - Resources/Literature/ |
| Entity | `person`, `organization` | 03 - Resources/People/, 03 - Resources/People/Organizations/ |
| External | `external-resource`, `tool` | External Resources/ |
| Navigation | `moc`, `index` | MOCs, sub-indexes |
| Area | `area` | 02 - Areas of Focus/ |
| Project | `project`, `plan`, `decision` | 01 - Projects/ |
| Reference | `reference`, `workflow`, `course-notes` | 03 - Resources/Obsidian Reference/, Courses/ |
| Other | `recipe-collection`, `fleeting-note` | Cooking & Recipes/, 05 - Watching/ |

### Two-Tier Literature System

Literature notes use `type: literature-note` with an optional `literatureType:` field for granularity:

| `literatureType:` value | When to use |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `research-paper` | Standard academic research paper |
| `empirical-study` | Data-driven empirical research |
| `position-paper` | Advocacy/opinion paper |
| `benchmark-paper` | Evaluation/benchmark study |
| `working-paper` | Preprint or draft paper |
| `perspective` | Perspective or viewpoint article |
| `modeling-study` | Computational or mathematical modeling |
| `randomized-controlled-trial` | RCT or clinical trial |
| `industry-report` | Industry/technical report |
| `dissertation` | Thesis or dissertation |
| `comment` | Commentary or response |
| `blog-research` | Research-focused blog post |

**Note**: `book-note` and `author-note` remain separate `type:` values (not literatureType).

## Edges as Interface Operations (Not Just Labels)

**Conceptual framing, important for how to use this vocabulary well.**

A typed edge is not a label that says "these two things are related." It is an **interface contract** that defines an *operation* the agent should perform when it traverses the edge. Each edge type has an expected behavior, an expected target type, and a semantic commitment that shapes how downstream retrieval and reasoning should handle it.

This framing matters because:

1. **Different edge types license different retrievals.** When an agent sees `extends:`, it expects the parent to supply inherited semantic context. When it sees `criticizes:`, it expects to find an unresolved contradiction that should trigger conflict-resolution logic before combining evidence. `supports:` licenses evidence aggregation; `criticizes:` licenses contradiction detection; `source:` licenses grounding checks. **These are not equivalent relationships with different names** — they invoke different operations.

2. **The set of edge types is an orthogonal basis.** Every typed edge you add is a new independent dimension along which notes can be navigated and compared. Unlike flat similarity retrieval (where everything collapses to one scalar distance), typed edges preserve separable semantic directions. This is why aggressive typing (minimize use of `related:`) produces a more navigable knowledge graph than loose typing.

3. **Edge types have domain and range.** `author:` points to a person; `source:` points to a literature note; `extends:` points to a theory or concept note. Violating the domain/range of an edge breaks the operation contract: an `extends:` pointing at an organization node has no meaningful operation an agent can run.

The practical guideline: **populate edge fields with the most specific type you can justify, and treat `related:` as a fallback for edges that don't have a specific semantic contract yet**. Over time, `related:` uses should become rarer as the edge vocabulary evolves to fit the work.

See `[[Bounded Branching - Why This Skill Checks the Fano Bound]]` in `03 - Resources/Obsidian Reference/` for the structural reason typed edges matter: they are what keeps the vault's navigation outside the no-escape regime that flat retrieval falls into.

## Edge Fields

Populate these in YAML frontmatter to create typed relationships. Each field maps to an RDF property via `scripts/kg/vault-context.jsonld` and becomes queryable in the vault's knowledge graph:

| Field | Meaning | Use when... | Example |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `up:` | Parent in hierarchy | Note belongs to a MOC or topic group | `up: "[[Your Topic MOC]]"` |
| `area:` | Area of focus served | Project or MOC serves an area of focus | `area: "[[Research & Scholarship]]"` |
| `concept:` | Concept this relates to | Literature discusses a concept; implementation realizes a concept | `concept: "[[Example Concept]]"` |
| `implementation:` | Code/system implementing this | Concept note has a corresponding repo/experiment | `implementation: "[[Example Framework]]"` |
| `source:` | Literature source | Any note citing a paper | `source: "[[Literature/@smith-2025-example]]"` |
| `extends:` | Builds upon | Theory note extends another theory | `extends: "[[Parent Theory]]"` |
| `criticizes:` | Challenges/opposes | Paper or note argues against a claim | `criticizes: "[[Contested Claim]]"` |
| `supports:` | Validates/agrees | Paper provides evidence for a claim | `supports: "[[Validated Hypothesis]]"` |
| `related:` | Lateral connection | General connection that doesn't fit above categories | Keep as catch-all but prefer specific relations |
| `author:` | Person who authored this work | Literature note, book note, or external resource has a known author with a vault note | `author: "[[smith-jane]]"` |
| `affiliation:` | Organization a person belongs to | Person or author note has a known institutional affiliation | `affiliation: "[[Example University]]"` |
| `collaborator:` | Person collaborating on a project | Project has known collaborators with vault notes | `collaborator: "[[doe-john]]"` |

See `[[Vault Vocabulary]]` for domain/range constraints on each edge field (which note types can use which fields, and what types they should point to).

## Rules for Claude

### When creating ANY new note
- Always include `type:` in frontmatter with a value from the taxonomy above

### When creating projects or MOCs
- Populate `area:` to link to the area of focus they serve (e.g., `area: "[[Research & Scholarship]]"`)
- Every project should connect to at least one area — if it doesn't, question why it exists

### When creating literature notes
- Populate `concept:`, `source:`, `supports:`/`criticizes:` where applicable
- Use `up:` to link to the relevant MOC
- Add `author:` edge (wikilink to author note) if the author has a vault note. The existing `authors:` string field stays for display; `author:` is the graph edge.

### When creating author notes (`type: author-note`)
- Use for researchers, writers, and thought leaders known primarily through their work
- Location: `03 - Resources/People/lastname-firstname.md`
- Must have: `up:` (typically `[[LITERATURE-INDEX]]`), `aliases:` (all name variants — citekey patterns, social handles, display name variations)
- Should have: `affiliation:` (if institutional affiliation is known), `area:` (if relevant to a specific area of focus)
- `aliases:` is critical — it's the glue that connects literature note citekeys and body text mentions to the same node

### When creating person notes (`type: person`)
- Use for collaborators, contacts, and people known through work rather than authorship
- Location: `03 - Resources/People/lastname-firstname.md`
- Should have: `affiliation:`, `up:` (to relevant MOC or VAULT-INDEX)
- A person can also be an author — if they start publishing work you track, consider upgrading to `type: author-note`

### When creating organization notes (`type: organization`)
- Use for institutions, labs, companies that recur across multiple notes or projects
- Location: `03 - Resources/People/Organizations/org-name.md`
- Only create when the organization is referenced by 3+ notes — don't create one-off org notes
- Should have: `up:` (to `[[PEOPLE-INDEX]]` or relevant MOC)

### When creating theory/concept notes
- Populate `up:`, `extends:`, `source:` where applicable
- Add `implementation:` if code exists for this concept

### When creating implementation notes
- Populate `concept:`, `source:` where applicable

### When editing existing notes
- Opportunistically add missing `type:` and edge field properties
- Replace `noteType:` with `type:` if encountered
- Remove legacy Dataview fields (`relatedConcepts`, `relatedLiterature`, `implementations`) when found
- Don't mass-retrofit — fix notes as you touch them

### General
- Prefer specific relations (`extends:`, `supports:`, `criticizes:`) over generic `related:`
- Wikilinks in prose body are still valuable for narrative connections — frontmatter edge fields don't replace them
- Use tag-style types only in tags array (e.g., `#status/draft`), not for note typing

## Curator Observation Fields

Optional frontmatter fields populated by note-creation skills when ontology fit is uncertain. The `/curator` skill harvests these for review.

| Field | Values | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `curator_status:` | `pending`, `reviewed`, `accepted`, `declined` | Processing state |
| `curator_suggested_type:` | Any canonical type value | Suggests a better type for the note |
| `curator_suggested_up:` | Wikilink to MOC/index | Suggests a better parent |
| `curator_observations:` | List of strings | Free-text reasoning behind suggestions |

### When to populate curator fields

- **Uncertain type fit**: The note straddles two types (e.g., both method and theory)
- **Missing edge type**: A key relationship doesn't map to any existing edge field
- **Domain clustering**: This is the 3rd+ note in an area that lacks a MOC
- **Scope drift**: A note's content has outgrown its type (e.g., a concept-note that's really a theory-note)
- **New vocabulary needed**: The note introduces terminology that could become a new type or literatureType

### Rules

- Fields are OPTIONAL — only populate when something noteworthy is observed
- `curator_suggested_type` must be from the canonical type taxonomy (or flag as "proposed: [new-type]")
- `curator_suggested_up` must be a wikilink to an existing or proposed MOC/index
- Notes with `curator_status: pending` are harvestable by `/curator review`
- See `[[Vault Vocabulary]]` for the full controlled vocabulary

## Deprecation Notes

| Old | New | Status |
|-----|-----|--------|
| `noteType:` | `type:` | Fix on contact |
| `relatedConcepts:` | `concept:` (edge field) | Remove on contact |
| `relatedLiterature:` | `source:` (edge field) | Remove on contact |
| `implementations:` | `implementation:` (edge field) | Remove on contact |
| `#type/concept` tag | `type: concept-note` frontmatter | Tag is supplementary only |

---

## Templates

Templates exist at:
- `Templates/Concept Note.md` — concept and theory notes
- `Templates/Literature Note.md` — papers and literature
- `Templates/Implementation Note.md` — code and experiments

Follow their frontmatter edge field patterns, using `type:` (not `noteType:`).
