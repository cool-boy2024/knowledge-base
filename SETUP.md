# Setup Guide

Detailed setup instructions for the agentic vault, organized by dependency tier. See the [README](README.md) for a quick start.

> **The onboarding skill (`/onboarding`) will check which tools are installed and guide you through what's missing.** You don't need to install everything upfront — start with Tier 0 and add capabilities as you need them.

---

## Tier 0 — Essential (required)

These are non-negotiable. The vault doesn't function without them.

### Homebrew (macOS package manager)
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Git
```bash
brew install git
```

### Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's agentic coding tool — it's the agent that operates inside this vault. It reads your files, creates notes, runs skills, and manages the knowledge graph. You need two things:

**1. An Anthropic account with API access**

Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com. You'll need a paid plan (Pro or Team) — Claude Code uses the API, which requires billing. The Max plan ($100/mo) includes Claude Code usage directly; otherwise you pay per-token via the API.

**2. Install Claude Code**

The recommended install is the CLI:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Verify
claude --version
```

See https://claude.com/product/claude-code for full install documentation.

Claude Code is also available as:
- **VS Code extension** — search "Claude Code" in the extensions marketplace
- **JetBrains extension** — search "Claude Code" in the plugin marketplace  
- **Desktop app** (macOS/Windows) — download from https://claude.ai/download
- **Web app** — https://claude.ai/code

The CLI is recommended for this vault because skills (`/encode`, `/onboarding`, etc.) work best in the terminal.

**3. Authenticate**

```bash
claude
# Follow the prompts to log in with your Anthropic account
```

Once authenticated, Claude Code stores credentials locally. You won't need to log in again on this machine.

### Obsidian
```bash
brew install --cask obsidian
```

After installing, open this folder as a vault in Obsidian.

---

## Tier 1 — Core CLI Tools (strongly recommended)

These make Claude Code significantly more effective. Install them all at once:

```bash
brew install ripgrep gh jq bat pandoc
brew install --cask quarto
```

| Tool | What it does | Why it matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **ripgrep** (`rg`) | Fast regex search | Claude Code's Grep tool uses this under the hood |
| **gh** | GitHub CLI | Create repos, PRs, issues from the terminal |
| **jq** | JSON processor | Query and transform JSON (used by KG pipeline, API responses) |
| **bat** | Syntax-highlighted cat | Better file viewing in terminal |
| **Quarto** | Document rendering (PDF, HTML, slides, DOCX) | The `/quarto` skill uses this to produce publication-quality output from vault content. Free and open source. |
| **Pandoc** | Document format conversion | Lower-level converter that Quarto builds on. Also useful standalone for quick format conversions. |

---

## Tier 2 — Knowledge Graph Pipeline (recommended)

Enables SPARQL queries on your vault's knowledge graph — multi-hop concept traversal, orphan detection, hub analysis, and **automatic enforcement of the vault's structural principles** via the `/audit` skill's Check F (Branching Factor / Fano Bound).

**Why this matters**: the vault's architecture imposes specific structural constraints — bounded branching (≤12 direct children per navigational node), typed edges as operation contracts, hierarchical retrieval over flat search. These are grounded in recent research on memory architectures for language agents (Barman et al. 2026 no-escape theorem; Hu et al. 2026 xMemory Fano bound; Janowicz 2015 pattern-based architecture). The knowledge graph pipeline is what lets `/audit` check the structural integrity automatically — without it, violations accumulate silently. See the [README's "Why Structured Hierarchy?" section](README.md#why-structured-hierarchy-research-basis) for the full rationale and supporting literature, and the vault doc [Bounded Branching — Why This Skill Checks the Fano Bound](03%20-%20Resources/Obsidian%20Reference/Bounded%20Branching%20-%20Why%20This%20Skill%20Checks%20the%20Fano%20Bound.md) for the methodology details.

### Python 3 + PyYAML
```bash
brew install python3
pip install pyyaml
```

The KG pipeline script (`scripts/kg/vault-to-jsonld.py`) only needs stdlib + PyYAML. No rdflib required.

### Apache Jena
```bash
brew install jena
```

This installs three tools:
- **`arq`** — SPARQL query engine (the main one you'll use)
- **`riot`** — RDF format converter (JSON-LD → Turtle)
- **`shacl`** — SHACL validation (checks graph integrity)

### Verify
```bash
arq --version    # Should show Apache Jena
riot --version
python3 -c "import yaml; print('PyYAML OK')"
```

### Configure namespace and build
```bash
# Set your namespace (or keep the default)
scripts/kg/setup-namespace.sh https://yourdomain.com/vault

# Build the graph (will be empty in a fresh vault — that's fine)
scripts/kg/build-graph.sh --stats
```

---

## Tier 3 — Obsidian CLI (recommended)

Built into Obsidian 1.12+. Provides indexed search that's 54x faster than grep.

1. Open Obsidian
2. Settings → General → Command line interface → **Enable**
3. Follow the instructions to add it to your PATH

### Verify
```bash
obsidian help
obsidian search query="test" limit=5
```

**If Obsidian isn't running**, the CLI won't work. Claude Code falls back to grep/Glob automatically.

---

## Tier 4 — Claude Code Plugins and Obsidian Skills (strongly recommended)

These extend Claude Code with skills it needs to work effectively with Obsidian vaults. Requires Node.js.

```bash
brew install node
```

### Obsidian Skills (from kepano/obsidian-skills)

**This is the most important external skill install.** It teaches Claude Code how to use Obsidian-specific syntax (wikilinks, callouts, frontmatter properties) and the Obsidian CLI.

```bash
# In a Claude Code session, run:
/install-plugin obsidian-skills
```

Or install from the command line:
```bash
claude plugins install obsidian@obsidian-skills --source https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills
```

This installs 5 skills:
- **`obsidian:obsidian-markdown`** — Wikilinks, embeds, callouts, properties, and Obsidian-specific syntax
- **`obsidian:obsidian-cli`** — The Obsidian CLI for search, read, tasks, backlinks, and more
- **`obsidian:defuddle`** — Clean web page extraction (strips navigation/ads to save tokens)
- **`obsidian:json-canvas`** — Create and edit Obsidian Canvas files
- **`obsidian:obsidian-bases`** — Database-like views of notes

**Dependency**: The defuddle skill requires the defuddle CLI:
```bash
npm install -g defuddle-cli
```

### Recommended Vault Skills

These three skills ship in the template's `.claude/skills/` directory but depend on external tools:

| Skill | What it does | Dependency |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `/alphaxiv-paper-lookup` | Look up arXiv papers with AI summaries | None — uses web |
| `/notebooklm` | Google NotebookLM API for research synthesis | Google account |
| `/quarto` | Render documents to PDF, HTML, slides | `brew install --cask quarto` |

### Superpowers Plugin (for code repos)

When working in git repos (not the vault), the Superpowers plugin adds project planning and code analysis capabilities:

```bash
# Install in a Claude Code session within a git repo:
/install-plugin superpowers
```

This is how you get repo-level project planning that complements vault-level planning. See the Cross-Repo Workflow section in the README.

---

## Tier 5 — Google Workspace Integration (recommended, free)

Requires a Google account and API setup. Gives Claude Code access to Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets.

### Setup steps
1. Create a Google Cloud project at https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Enable the APIs you need (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc.)
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Install the GWS skills: `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code-skills install gws`
5. Authenticate: `gws auth login`

The `gws-shared` skill has detailed setup instructions. Run `/gws-shared` in Claude Code for a walkthrough.

---

## Tier 6 — Premium Integrations (optional, paid)

These accelerate specific workflows. Free alternatives exist for each — see [[Integration Ecosystem]].

### Readwise (~$8/mo)
Automatic highlight sync from Kindle, web, podcasts.
- Install the Readwise Official Obsidian plugin (Settings → Community plugins)
- Install the processing skill separately (not included in template)

### Todoist (~$4/mo)
Task management with projects, labels, priorities.
```bash
npm install -g @doist/todoist-cli
td login
```

### Paperpile (~$3/mo)
Reference management with Google Docs integration. Alternative: **Zotero** (free, open source).

## Recommended Brewfile

For a complete one-command setup of Tiers 0-2 plus useful tools:

```bash
# Save as Brewfile, then run: brew bundle
# Tier 0 — Essential
brew "git"
cask "obsidian"
# Tier 1 — Core CLI tools
brew "ripgrep"
brew "gh"
brew "jq"
brew "bat"
brew "pandoc"
cask "quarto"
# Tier 2 — Knowledge Graph
brew "jena"
# Tier 4 — Node.js ecosystem
brew "node"
# Useful extras
brew "tree"
brew "fzf"
```

```bash
# Install everything
brew bundle

# Then Python deps
pip install pyyaml
```

---

## Verifying Your Setup

The `/onboarding` skill checks for installed tools automatically. You can also run this manually:

```bash
echo "=== Tier 0 ==="
which git && echo "✓ git" || echo "✗ git"
which claude && echo "✓ claude" || echo "✗ claude (Claude Code)"
which obsidian && echo "✓ obsidian" || echo "✗ obsidian"

echo "=== Tier 1 ==="
which rg && echo "✓ ripgrep" || echo "✗ ripgrep"
which gh && echo "✓ gh" || echo "✗ gh"
which jq && echo "✓ jq" || echo "✗ jq"

echo "=== Tier 2 ==="
which arq && echo "✓ jena (arq)" || echo "✗ jena"
python3 -c "import yaml" 2>/dev/null && echo "✓ pyyaml" || echo "✗ pyyaml"

echo "=== Tier 3 ==="
obsidian help >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "✓ obsidian CLI" || echo "✗ obsidian CLI (app may not be running)"

echo "=== Tier 4 ==="
which node && echo "✓ node" || echo "✗ node"
which npx && echo "✓ npx" || echo "✗ npx"
```
